1.0000 2010-02-24
 - Enabled keep alives, which speeds up requests. 
 - Added an FAQ.
 - Quoting doesn't quote itemName().
 - Fixed the copy() method.
 - Fixed broken documentation on the new() method in SimpleDB::Class::Item.
 - Now using Moose attributes for SimpleDB attributes created by the add_attributes() method in SimpleDB::Class::Item. Thanks to Paul Driver for his help in this.
 - belongs_to generated methods now return undef rather than dying if the associated attribute has no value.
 - Fixed a bug with date strings.
 - Now works with multi-value items by declaring a field to be either Str or ArrayRefOfStr (or any other valid type Int, DateTime, HashRef). This is incompatible with the way that it used to work.
 - Now using MooseX::Types for data validation and coercion. 
 - Implemented RFE #54786: SimpleDB::Class::HTTP should use XML::Simple with ForceArray for Item 
 - Implemented RFE #54617: Wishlist: parameterized domain names

0.0802 2010-01-28
 - Fixed a couple problems with calling 'next tokens' on result sets.
 - Added dependency on Clone.
 - Added option to pass in SimpleDB URI.
 - Now caching LWP::UserAgent so it doesn't get created for every request, which will speed up access timess.

0.0801 2010-01-19
 - Fixed a problem with fetching items from cache.
 - Fixed some documentation.
 - Fixed some test bugs.
 - Released 0.0800 as 0.0702 by accident.
 - Added more author tests.

0.0800 2010-01-09
 - Found and fixed a major bug where id's were getting reset on items returned from result sets.
 - Removed AnyEvent support, because of a misunderstanding we were using it synchronously, which basically defeated the purpose.
 - Added dependencies on Time::HiRes and LWP.
 - Removed dependencies on AnyEvent and AnyEvent::HTTP.

0.0701 2010-01-06
 - Fixed SQL author tests.
 - Fixed parsing of empty integers returned from SimpleDB.

0.0700 2010-01-05
 - Added a count() method to the result set.
 - Added order by and limit clauses to the search() method in domains.
 - Added min() and max() methods to domains.
 - Documentation fixes.
 - Moved SimpleDB::Class::ResultSet::handle_item() to SimpleDB::Class::Role::Itemized::parse_item().

0.0600 2009-12-31
 - Added recasting to support multiple similar object types represented in a single domain. See SimpleDB::Class::Item::recast_using() for details.

0.0502 2009-12-29
 - If SimpleDB returns a null result set, it turns into an empty hashref of attributes and SimpleDB::Class wasn't dealing with that properly.
 - Was trying to cache undefined items in a couple places, that's fixed now.
 - Fix some exception documentation.

0.0501 2009-12-29
 - Wasn't setting replace on attributes, updates kept adding them over and over again.

0.0500 2009-12-29
 - Added support for triggers on item attributes.
 - Added update(), delete(), and search() to result sets.
 - Note that to make the search() work on result sets, an id field is automatically added to every domain. This unfortunately means that existing domains that don't have an id field populated with the id of the item aren't compatible with the search() method on the result set.

0.0400 - 2009-12-28
 - Added support for HashRef field types in Items. Note that JSONified they cannot exceed 1024 characters.
 - Now supports 15 digit positive integers and 9 digit negative integers.
 - Added a couple tests to make sure attribute methods are created.
 - Fixed some documentation bugs.
 - Fixed a bug with a the retry timer in SimpleDB::Class::HTTP, where it would hang.

0.0300 - 2009-12-20
 - Rethought the whole subclassing approach. Now subclassing the result rather than the domain, and everything is much cooler, and is much closer to DBIx::Class. Check out the docs for API changes.
 - While rewriting discovered that all relationship and attribute methods were global (all classes in the schema got them), which is a huge bug. This problemhas been eliminated in this version as well.
 - Added Sub::Name to the prereqs.

0.0201 - 2009-12-19
 - Some documentation fixes.
 - Cleaned up relationship code.
 - Attempted in-item indexed relationships, but abandoned it due to race conditions. Check out commits a3c651797a5d3924be129300bf08500e0e3c6f2d and 04709b014317d9c15dc265323cde71a647e072d9 to investigate in the future.

0.0200 - 2009-12-18
 - Split HTTP functionality out into it's own module.
 - Added async calls to HTTP requests for use with multitaskers like POE and Coro.
 - Fixed a bug where retries on failed connections were infinite.
 - Added link to PB.
 - Removed author from POD except in main docs.
 - Added prereqs AnyEvent::HTTP and Net::SSLeay.
 - Removed prereqs Crypt::SSLeay, Time::HiRes, LWP::UserAgent, and HTTP::Request.

0.0100 - 2009-12-17
 - Add memcached as a front-end layer to get around the eventual consistency problem.
 - Fixed the Foo problem with CPAN.
 - Fixed a few linking problems in the docs.
 - Added Crypt::SSLeay as a prereq. Forgot to it in the last release. Amazon API only works over SSL, so this is required.
 - Added Memcached::libmemcached as a prereq.
 - Added "Support" section to docs.

0.0001 - 2009-12-02
 - Initial public release.
